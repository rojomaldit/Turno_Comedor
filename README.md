### **Python code that reserves a place in the university canteen for you :D :D**    

**Install dependencies:**    
`pip install BeautifulSoup requests python-telegram-bot`    

**How to use it:**    
Well, theres two simple mains you could read on your own, but I'll explain them anyways.    

1 - **main_file:** It reads a line separated 'codes.txt' file with all the codes.    
2 - **main_term:** It reads all codes given by terminal.    

**Examples:**    
main_term.py    
`python main_term.py code1 code2 code 3 ... code n`    
main_file.py    
`python main_file.py`    
While 'codes.txt' file is:    
>code 1    
>code 2    
>code 3    
>...    
>code n
